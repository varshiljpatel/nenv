## Problem Statement

Managing `.env` files in modern applications can be cumbersome and error-prone. Developers often face challenges such as:

- Accidentally committing sensitive `.env` files to version control.
- Manually managing `.env` files across multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Lack of encryption for `.env` files, leaving sensitive data exposed.

These issues can lead to security vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and unnecessary complexity in managing environment variables.

---

## Solution: `nenv`

`nenv` is a CLI tool designed to simplify and secure the management of `.env` files. With `nenv`, you can:

- **Encrypt** your `.env` files into `.nenv` files, ensuring sensitive data is protected.
- **Decrypt** `.nenv` files back into `.env` files when needed.
- Specify custom paths and filenames for `.env` and `.nenv` files.
- Automatically update your `.gitignore` file to exclude `.nenv` files from version control.

`nenv` ensures that your environment variables are secure and easy to manage across different environments.

## Features

- üîí **Encryption**: Securely encrypt `.env` files into `.nenv` files using AES-256 encryption.
- üîì **Decryption**: Decrypt `.nenv` files back into `.env` files when needed.
- üìÇ **Custom Paths**: Specify custom paths and filenames for `.env` and `.nenv` files.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- üìú **Automatic `.gitignore` Updates**: Automatically adds `.nenv` files to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

---

## Installation

You can install `nenv` using your favorite package manager:

### npm

```bash
npm install -g @varshiljpatel/nenv
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g @varshiljpatel/nenv
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn global add @varshiljpatel/nenv
```

### bun

```bash
bun add -g @varshiljpatel/nenv
```

---

> You can also access the cli via ```nenv ...``` and ```no.env ...``` command.

## Usage

### Encrypting `.env` Files

To encrypt a `.env` file into a `.nenv` file, use the `encrypt` command:

```bash
nenv encrypt <password>
```

#### Options:

- `--env <path>`: Path to the `.env` file (default: `./`).
- `--name <filename>`: Name of the `.env` file (default: `.env`).
- `--output <path>`: Directory where the `.nenv` file will be saved (default: `./`).

#### Example:

```bash
nenv encrypt mypassword --env=./src/frontend --name=.env.local --output=./src/frontend
```

This command:

- Encrypts the `.env.local` file located in `./src/frontend`.
- Saves the encrypted `.nenv` file in the `./src/frontend` directory.

---

### Decrypting `.nenv` Files

To decrypt a `.nenv` file back into a `.env` file, use the `decrypt` command:

```bash
nenv decrypt <password>
```

#### Options:

- `--env <path>`: Path to the `.nenv` file (default: `./`).
- `--name <filename>`: Name of the output `.env` file (default: `.env`).

#### Example:

```bash
nenv decrypt mypassword --env=./src/frontend --name=.env.local
```

This command:

- Decrypts the `.nenv` file located in `./src/frontend`.
- Saves the decrypted `.env.local` file in the same directory.

---

### Automatic `.gitignore` Updates

`nenv` automatically updates your `.gitignore` file to include the `.nenv` file. This ensures that encrypted files are not accidentally committed to version control.

---

## How It Works

### Encryption

1. Reads the contents of the `.env` file.
2. Encrypts the contents using AES-256 encryption with a user-provided password.
3. Saves the encrypted data as a `.nenv` file in the specified output directory.

### Decryption

1. Reads the contents of the `.nenv` file.
2. Decrypts the contents using AES-256 decryption with the same password used for encryption.
3. Saves the decrypted data as a `.env` file in the specified directory.
